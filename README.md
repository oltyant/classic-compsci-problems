Classic Computer Science problems solved in multiple languages

Following the book "Classic Computer Science problems in Swift (Manning)" and solving the problems in multiple languages.

Languages to use (plan):
* **Swift**
* **Java**
* **Scala**
* **Haskell**
* Clojure
* Ocaml
* Rust

## Notes:
* This is also a learning and experimentation project to study how to do idiomatic programming in these languages. For what reason? Mainly just fore fun (yet obviously - as a side effect - I expect some improvement in my problem solving skill as these languages tend to use different techniques and paradigms so I think this exercise will give me more ideas when I solve problems in the future).
* Just to see how good is my solution in different languages - I make some performance tests and show how they performed to each other under each problem.
* I have been working with Java for more than 10 years and with Scala for 5 years therefore the Java and Scala solutions can be considered as the most idiomatic ones. Because nowadays I prefer functional programming over imperative/OO programming therefore sometimes I introduce new solutions which are not in the book. Even if I do this I try not to hack and rape the used languages just for sake of the FP, so I always try to do the most idiomatic solution (well Haskell is an exception as it is a pure FP language so I do not have other possibility just to use only FP techniques :) ). After all, in our day to day work we do not usually leave the idiomatic boundaries of the languages.
